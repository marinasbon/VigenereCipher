# VigenereCipher
Java Vigenère Cipher Brute-Force Cracking Algorithm

This Java program implements a brute-force algorithm to crack Vigenère cyphers. The Vigenère cypher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. The program systematically tries every key length possible to decrypt the message and prints plaintext results.
